# Advanced Product Behavioral Analytics

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end product analytics case study built on simulated mobile app data. 
It demonstrates real-world analytics practices including:

- Behavioral data simulation
- Funnel and cohort analysis
- A/B testing (Frequentist + Bayesian light)
- Propensity score modeling (causal validation)
- Survival analysis for retention decay
- LTV prediction
- User segmentation (clustering)
- SQL-style KPI analysis

The goal is to simulate actionable insights for product growth, monetization, and user engagement.

## Business Objectives

1. Identify behavioral drivers of 30-day retention.
2. Measure feature impact on purchase probability.
3. Evaluate A/B test performance and causality.
4. Predict Lifetime Value (LTV) across segments.
5. Discover high-value user clusters.

## Key Findings

- Tutorial completion is the strongest predictor of retention.
- Premium feature exposure increases purchase probability.
- iOS users show slightly higher retention than Android (+2pp), though monetization is similar.
- Treatment group shows measurable A/B uplift.
- High-engagement users generate 3–4x higher LTV.
- Clustering reveals a distinct high-value segment (~20% of users).
